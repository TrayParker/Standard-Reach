🧾 Standard Reach — Welcome & Guidelines

Welcome to Standard Reach, a collaborative marketing agency dedicated to creativity, integrity, and measurable impact.
Before joining campaigns, projects, or community discussions, please review and agree to the following guidelines.

🔐 1. Professional Conduct

Treat all clients, team members, and partners with respect — no harassment, discrimination, or hostility.

Follow Standard Reach’s communication standards and maintain professionalism in all interactions.

Keep discussions on-topic and productive — avoid spam, excessive self-promotion, or irrelevant content.

Confidentiality is key. Do not share client materials or project details outside of approved channels.

💼 2. Project & Collaboration Rules

All work must go through official Standard Reach workflows (Trello, Notion, or assigned project channels).

Only claim projects or campaigns assigned to you by management.

Always credit assets, references, or collaborations properly.

Unauthorized use of copyrighted material or AI-generated content without approval is prohibited.

Deliver all assigned tasks by the agreed deadlines; communicate early if delays arise.

🧾 3. Client Interaction

Represent Standard Reach professionally in all client communications.

Do not negotiate private deals or side agreements with clients.

Keep written records of client approvals, deliverables, and revisions.

Maintain transparency — never misrepresent results, credentials, or data.

🚫 4. Prohibited Activity

No unethical marketing practices (e.g., fake reviews, misleading claims, or spam campaigns).

No sharing of confidential data, client information, or internal assets.

No external sales, promotions, or recruiting unrelated to Standard Reach projects.

No discrimination or toxicity toward clients or teammates.

🧰 5. Support & Reporting

For workflow issues, client concerns, or team disputes, contact your assigned project manager or HR representative.

Use the official #support or #project-help channels (or internal ticket system) for inquiries.

All reports are reviewed confidentially and handled with professionalism.

⚠️ 6. Accountability

You are responsible for the quality and accuracy of your work.

Breaches of ethics, confidentiality, or professionalism may result in removal from projects or partnerships.

Regular audits ensure compliance with Standard Reach policies.
